# 1.Mixed Messages Javascript Project
- This JavaScript program generates random messages every time the user runs the program. This is also the 1st portfolio project of the Full-Stack Engineering (web development) career path in Codecademy.
- For my version of the "Mixed Messages" program: Everytime the user runs the program, it returns 3 pieces
of random life advice for the user (one for workplace advice, one for financial advice, and one for health advice).

# 4.Lessons Learned:
- Experience with fundamentals of JavaScript structures and syntax.
- Experience with various Github commands(i.e. clone, pull, commit, push, etc.).
- Experience dividing program into modular components (like splitting code into functions and importing large arrays from separate files).
