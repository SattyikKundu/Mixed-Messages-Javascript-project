# Mixed Messages Javascript Project
This JavaScript program generates random messages every time the user runs the program. This is also the 1st portfolio project of the Full-Stack Engineering (web development) career path in Codecademy.

For my version of the "Mixed Messages" program: Everytime the user runs the program, it returns 3 pieces
of random life advice for the user (one for workplace advice, one for financial advice, and one for health advice).
